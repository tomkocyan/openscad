# OpenSCAD 3D Models

This is my playground for 3D modeling experiments using OpenSCAD. The project contains various designs that can be customized with different parameters and icons.

## Project Structure

- `icons/` - SVG icons for models
- `export/` - Generated STL and other output files
- `*.scad` - OpenSCAD models

## Current Models

### Keychain
A customizable keychain with:
- Customizable icon selection
- Adjustable dimensions
- Parametric eyelet (keyring hole) positioning
- Two-color design (white base, blue icon)
- Export-ready for 3D printing

## Usage

1. Place your SVG icon in the `icons/` folder
2. Open desired `.scad` file in OpenSCAD
3. Adjust parameters to your liking
4. Render and export to STL
5. 3D print your custom model

## Parameters

Each model has its own set of customizable parameters, typically including:
- Dimensions and sizes
- Positions of elements
- Colors (for visualization)
- Custom icons and graphics

## License

Feel free to use and modify this project for your own needs.
