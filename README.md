# OpenSCAD 3D Models

This is my playground for 3D modeling experiments using OpenSCAD. The project contains various designs that can be customized with different parameters and icons.

## Current Models

### 5 CZK Coin
A model of a 5 CZK coin designed for toy carts:
- Accurate dimensions (23 mm diameter, 1.85 mm thickness)
- Embossed number "5" with rounded font
- Raised edge for better grip
- Optimized for 3D printing

### Keychain
A customizable keychain with:
- Customizable icon selection
- Adjustable dimensions
- Parametric eyelet (keyring hole) positioning
- Export-ready for 3D printing

## Usage

1. Open desired `.scad` file in OpenSCAD
2. Adjust parameters to your liking
3. Render and export to STL
4. 3D print your custom model

## Parameters

Each model has its own set of customizable parameters, typically including:
- Dimensions and sizes
- Positions of elements
- Custom icons and graphics

## License

Feel free to use and modify this project for your own needs.
